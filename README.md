# Todo App v2

Looking to develop into Book Reading tracker for my 18month old Son.

Initially I wanted practice with React & MySQL to make a simple Todo app. The first version I utilised Create React App, and realised pretty quickly how hard it was to implement a backend API. I eventually got it working but running with 2 servers in different terminals. I created a CRUD database using MySQL. Used AXIOS on the Front End, to interact with an API.

This time around I am going with NextJS as I had been told it is easier to create a back end.

## Stack

- NextJS
- TypeScript
- Express
- MySQL
- Axios
